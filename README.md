# 🍅 Tomato Disease Predictor

Hi there! 👋  
This is my **Tomato Disease Predictor** project — a simple machine learning web app that can identify common tomato leaf diseases from an image.  
The goal is to help farmers and gardeners detect plant problems early and keep their crops healthy. 🌱

---
## What It Does
- Lets you **upload a tomato leaf image**
- Uses a trained **CNN model** to predict the disease
- Shows the **disease name** and **confidence score**
- Works right from your browser — no coding needed!

---

## 🧠 Tech Behind It
- **Python** for the main logic  
- **Flask** (or Streamlit) for the web interface  
- **TensorFlow / Keras** for deep learning  
- **OpenCV** for image handling  
- **HTML, CSS, JS** for the frontend  

The model is trained on the **Tomato Leaf Disease Dataset**, which includes categories like:
> Early Blight, Late Blight, Bacterial Spot, Leaf Mold, Septoria Leaf Spot, and Healthy leaves.
